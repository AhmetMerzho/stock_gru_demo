# Multi-Stock GRU Prediction Demo

This repository contains a static demonstration web app that visualises prediction quality for a pre-trained GRU model across multiple equities. The app is fully client-side and works seamlessly when published to GitHub Pages.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in any modern browser or serve the repository with your preferred static file host. The landing page lets you:

- Choose between curated datasets that bundle engineered features and synthetic GRU outputs.
- Inspect global metrics such as the best-performing stock and average dataset accuracy.
- Explore a stock-by-stock accuracy ranking and interactive prediction timelines.
- Drill into each prediction via the sortable data table.

Because everything runs client-side, no additional build step is required.
